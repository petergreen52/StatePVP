StatePVP

Minecraft Bukkit Plugin to modify PVP mechanics.

The goal of this plugin is to add a more realistic PVP mechanic the game.  There is a lack of consequence currently when you die.  If you die, you can run back to where you were and confront the agressor imediate.  Some people even die just to regain hunger.  People take life for granted and think it's not such a bad thing.  This, in my opinion, makes PVP less fun and interesting.

Imagine if people could be wounded, and this effected speed and attack power.  Imagine if you healed at a more realistic rate.  People would be much more cautious of their health.  Imagine if you could incapacitace your opponents on the battle field instead of killing them, leaving them to die if friendlies didn't treat them.  This would make PVP much more interesting and strategic.  You would have to work as a team to keep everyone alive.  This fixes the big downfall I think PVP has; its indivisualness.  It's much more fun to be on a team, that's why people play on servers.
